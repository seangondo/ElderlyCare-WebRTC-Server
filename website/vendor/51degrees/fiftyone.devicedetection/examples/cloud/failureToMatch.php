/**
 * @example cloud/failureToMatch.php
 *
 * This example shows how the hasValue function can help make sure
 * that meaningful values * are returned when checking properties
 * returned from the device detection engine.
 *
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-php/blob/master/examples/cloud/failureToMatch.php).
 *
 * To run this example, you will need to create a **resource key**.
 * The resource key is used as short-hand to store the particular set of
 * properties you are interested in as well as any associated license keys
 * that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties.
 * You can create a resource key using the 51Degrees [Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com).
 *
 * Expected output:
 *
 * ```
 * Does User-Agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 11_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/604.4.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15C114' represent a mobile device?:
 * Yes
 * 
 * Does User-Agent 'xyfga' represent a mobile device?:
 * We don't know for sure. The reason given is:
 * No matching entries could be found for the supplied evidence.
 * This is because the supplied User-Agent cannot be mapped to any known device.
 * ```
