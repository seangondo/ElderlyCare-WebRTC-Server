 * 
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-php/blob/master/examples/cloud/gettingStartedWeb.php). 
 * 
 * @include{doc} example-require-resourcekey.txt
 * 
 * Required Composer Dependencies:
 * - 51degrees/fiftyone.devicedetection
 * 
 * ## Overview
 * 
 * The `DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder` class is used to create a Pipeline instance from the configuration
 * that is supplied.
 * The fiftyone\pipeline\core\Utils module contains helpers which deal with
 * automatically populating evidence from a web request.
 * ```{php}
 * $flowdata->evidence->setFromWebRequest()
 * ```
 *
 * The module can also handling setting response headers (e.g. Accept-CH for User-Agent 
 * Client Hints) and serving requests for client-side JavaScript and JSON resources.
 * ```{php}
 * Utils::setResponseHeader($flowdata);
 * ```
 * 
 * The results of detection can be accessed by through the flowdata object once
 * processed. This can then be used to interrogate the data.
 * ```{php}
 * $flowdata->process();
 * $device = $flowdata->device;
 * $hardwareVendor = $device->hardwarevendor;
 * ```
 * 
 * Results can also be accessed in client-side code by using the `fod` object. See the 
 * [JavaScriptBuilderElement](https://51degrees.com/pipeline-php/4.3/classfiftyone_1_1pipeline_1_1core_1_1_javascript_builder_element.html)
 * for details on available settings such as changing the `fod` name.
 * ```{js}
 * window.onload = function () {
 *     fod.complete(function(data) {
 *         var hardwareName = data.device.hardwarename;
 *         alert(hardwareName.join(", "));
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
