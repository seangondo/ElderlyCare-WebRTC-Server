/**
 * @example cloud/userAgentClientHints-Web.php
 *
 * @include{doc} example-web-integration-client-hints.txt
 *
 * This example shows how a simple device detection pipeline can be built
 * that checks if a provided User-Agent is a mobile device
 *
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-php/blob/master/examples/cloud/userAgentClientHints-Web.php).
 *
 * To run this example, you will need to create a **resource key**.
 * The resource key is used as short-hand to store the particular set of
 * properties you are interested in as well as any associated license keys
 * that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties.
 * You can create a resource key using the 51Degrees [Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com).
 * Make sure to include required User Agent Client Hints Set Header properties which are in the following format, to get full * client-hints functionality.
 * SetHeader[Component name][Response header name]
 
 * Expected output:
 * ```
 * User Agent Client Hints Example
 * Select the Use User Agent Client Hints button below, to use User Agent Client Hint headers in evidence for device 
 * detections.
 * ...
 * Hardware Vendor: Unknown
 * Hardware Name: Array
 * Device Type: Desktop
 * ...
 * ```

    <p>
    By default, the user-agent, sec-ch-ua and sec-ch-ua-mobile HTTP headers
    are sent.
    <br />
    This means that on the first request, the server can determine the
    browser from sec-ch-ua while other details must be derived from the
    user-agent.
    <br />
    If the server determines that the browser supports client hints, then
    it may request additional client hints headers by setting the
    Accept-CH header in the response.
    <br />
    Select the <strong>Make second request</strong> button below,
    to use send another request to the server. This time, any
    additional client hints headers that have been requested
    will be included.
    </p>

<button type='button' onclick='redirect()'>Make second request</button>

<script>

    // This script will run when button will be clicked and device detection request will again 
    // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
    // response by the server.
    // Following sequence will be followed.
    // 1. User will send the first request to the web server for detection.
    // 2. Web Server will return the properties in response based on the headers sent in the request. Along 
    // with the properties, it will also send a new header field Accept-CH in response indicating the additional
    // evidence it needs. It builds the new response header using SetHeader[Component name]Accept-CH properties 
    // where Component Name is the name of the component for which properties are required.
    // 3. When \"Make second request\" button will be clicked, device detection request will again 
    // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
    // response by the server.
    // 4. Web Server will return the properties based on the new User Agent CLient Hint headers 
    // being used as evidence.
